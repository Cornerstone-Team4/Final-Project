This was accomplished in the landing page.

***Game 1:*** Prime number quiz.
The game consists in a input for a number, and a check to see if it is a prime or not.

***Game 2:*** Calculator.
This game consists in a calculator that takes two numbers, a operation and a result, and outputs if the result is right or wrong.

***Game 3:*** Lottery.
This game consists in a random number generator and three input numbers, and outputs how many numbers the kid got right in and out of order, and the best sequence the kid made.

### Additional Goals
